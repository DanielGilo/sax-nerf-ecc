1. Used CUDA 11.7 (not sure necessary)
2. export TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="8.9+PTX"
had to change cpp_extensions.py file in torch to include the new arch:

#line 1748
        ('Ampere', '8.0;8.6+PTX'),
        ('Ada', '8.9+PTX'),
    ])

    supported_arches = ['3.5', '3.7', '5.0', '5.2', '5.3', '6.0', '6.1', '6.2',
                        '7.0', '7.2', '7.5', '8.0', '8.6', '8.9']
